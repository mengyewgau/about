# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### Who am I?
Hey there! I'm Meng Yew, but you can call me Michael if you like! I am an undergraduate in National University of Singapore, pursuing a double degree (BBA/BSc) in Business Administration (Finance) and Business Analytics (Machine Learning). 

### Why did I make this?
After failing to board my flight and being stranded in Canada for a week, I had way too much time on my hands!

I decided to pick up some frontend development and experimented with my own website! I followed YouTube tutorials (explaining the remarkable resemblance to other sites) and slowly learnt from there!

### Check out the website!
The site is currently hosted on https://mygau91.github.io/personal-website/ 

Do leave me feedback if you have any, or get in touch with me! My contact information is on my website hehe.
