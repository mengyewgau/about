# My personal website!

### Who am I?

As an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, I am currently pursuing a double degree in Business Administration (Finance) and Business Analytics (Machine Learning). Throughout my academic journey, I have actively sought internships in diverse industries, taking on varying roles and responsibilities. It was during these experiences that I discovered my strong inclination towards software engineering, particularly in the context of finance. This realization has fueled my passion to pursue a career at the intersection of technology and finance.

### Why did I make this?

After failing to board my flight and being stranded in Canada for a week, I had way too much time on my hands!

I decided to pick up some frontend development and experimented with my own website! I followed YouTube tutorials (explaining the remarkable resemblance to other sites) and slowly learnt from there!
